In iOS all editors in every container ScrollView, VerticalStackLayout or Grids don't scroll and the content doesnt move down when input is entered to scroll to the changes (Other container types wernt tested but its most likely occuring in every type)

AutoSize, HeightRequest and no settings all don't scroll

Tested with Maui v7.0.92
